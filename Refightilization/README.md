# Info

Allows players to respawn as a monster when they die. Highly configurable.

## Configuring for Single Player

If you ever want to mess with this mod while in single player, there are some config options to change.

| Key | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
|EndGameWhenEverybodyDead|false|The run would've ended after the first death.|
|RespawnDelay|0.0|The run would've ended because there are no players alive for a frame.|
|RespawnTeam|1|The run would've been softlocked because you can't charge the teleporter.|
|AdditionalRespawnTime|0.0|The run would've ended because there are no players alive for a frame.|

# Issues

- Artifact of Metamorphosis will spawn you as a random survivor as opposed to a random monster.
- [BetterUI](https://thunderstore.io/package/XoXFaby/BetterUI/), [Busted Diabolo Strike](https://thunderstore.io/package/farofus/Captain_Busted_Diablo_Strike/), and [Bandit Tweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Moffein/Bandit_Tweaks/) will flood the console when the player respawns. Seemingly does nothing else.
