# Info

Allows players to respawn as a monster when they die. Highly configurable.

It's recommended to also have [Unmodded Version](https://thunderstore.io/package/frostycpu/UnmoddedVersion/) installed to avoid having clients install the mod to join the server, but its not required.

## Configuring for Single Player

If you ever want to mess with this mod while in single player, there are some config options to change.

| Key | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
|EndGameWhenEverybodyDead|false|The run will end after the first death if this was disabled.|
|RespawnDelay|0.0|The run will end because there are no players.|
|RespawnTeam|1|You won't be able to charge the teleporter.|
